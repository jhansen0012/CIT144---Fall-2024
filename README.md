This is nothing more than a collection of programs and code that I wrote while taking CIT120 in June of 2024. At the time of writing this, I am currently taking CIT144; you may download these if you wish but, if you are just getting into coding, do yourself a favor and do not copy them word for word. Instead, study the elements that are there and try to impliment them into your own code. You will learn more that way!
