This is a collection of programs that I built while I was taking CIT-120 and CIT-144. For anyone in working towards their degree in Computer Science, and having a hard time grasping the complexities that come with coding, you are free to use these as examples. Since they were built by someone who was also still learning, they will likely be easier to understand for someone who is also a beginner.

My only request, is that you be honest and not copy them for your own work. Try to use what I wrote as a blueprint for whatever you are working on. You will learn more and retain far more by doing it yourself! Making mistakes is the best way to learn how to do this.
